#Projects
- Adventure Game (User Input & Serialization, Fixing Issues, Objects: Methods & Inheritance)
- Static Site Generator (Mini Project 1 & 2)
- Sudoku solver

#Weeks

The general pattern is to have a mini-project for each week that requires all of the topics being taught in that week to complete. My initial thought is to start with a description of what the finished project should do (as disctinct from _how_ it does it), then an outline of what we already know about how to accomplish that, and then start the day's instruction with stuff that will supply one missing piece.

##Week 1

This is Core JavaScript. The vast majority of the topics here will come fromthe Evening class materials. This week will be different from most of them because there will not be a week-long mini-project.

**Monday** will be a half-day; the first part of the day will be a picnic at Laurelhurst Park. The afternoon will be fairly packed, with topics including:

  - Outline of the class structure
  - names
  - resources (eg the class site)

before we even get to the JavaScript:

  - primitives, concatenation, & autoconversion
  - booleans
  - assignment, equality, and identity
  - variables
  - operators,expressions, & statements
  - the Node REPL
  - the browser console

**Tuesday** will focus on more basics, and will also introduce Git and the basics of a Git workflow. The actual installation of Git can wait until the end of class, so that people aren't waiting for downloads and compiles when they could be learning to code. Topics include:

  - || and &&
  - truthiness
  - conditionals and branching
  - debugging with `console.log`
  - blocks and loops
  - git

**Wednesday** Introduces the concept of functions, and also array basics:

  - Function basics: parameters vs. arguments, return values, and definition vs. call
  - local vars, hoisting, scope, and shadowing
  - arrays as a container of stuff (no methods yet; that's tomorrow)

Exercises for the day include:

  - The 12 Days of Christmas (nested loops)
  - The initial version of the Cards problem

**Thursday** is focused mostly on making sure your code works right, but also introduces methods for the first time:

  - basic assertions
  - defensive programming & parameter checks
  - Intro to string & array methods

Exercises for the day include:

  - defensive cards

**Friday** is all about higher-order functions--specifically, functions that take other functions as arguments:

  - anonymous functions
  - forEach
  - map
  - filter
  - sort
  - reduce

Exercises for the day include:

  - Write your own version of forEach/map/etc.

## Week 2

This week is all about objects, with a little bit of closures and IIFEs thrown in for good measure. Like the previous week, in-class exercises will be primarily drawn from the Evening class materials.

**Monday** covers what objects are and how properties work:

  - properties vs. variables
  - property creation, deletion, and enumeration
  - [] vs dot-notation, reference chains
  - Objects: incremental creation, literal notation, and nesting

**Tuesday** gets more into how objects are used and what they do:

  - Example roles of objects
  - custom methods, `this`, and dynamic scoping
  - string methods & string wrapper objects
  - arrays as objects & array methods
  - Object linking & sharing, shallow copy & compare, null, reference arguments
  - references

**Wednesday** begins to get back into functions, and also talks about global objects and properties:

  - global vars vs. properties
  - `this` as global
  - call operators and types of ()
  - scoping
  - functions as objects

**Thursday** is factory functions:

  - duplicate vs. shared methods
  - factory functions

**Friday** comes back around to closures:

  - private variables & functions
  - closures & access control

##Week 3

This week is the introduction to Node: modules, asynchrony, and working with the file system. It will also be the introduction to testing. The project for the week will be the sudoku solver.

##Week 4

Here, we get into the client. Topics will include the DOM, jQuery, REST, AJAX, APIs, promises, and testing in the browser. The project for the week will be some sort of display thing for information from the Treehouse API, possibly including a course suggester. Clearly, this needs to be fleshed out.

##Week 5
Labor Day break!

##Week 6

After the break, we come back and dive into the back end: Express, servers, curl, routes, Handlebars templates, and testing routes & servers will be covered. The exercise for the week will be a static site generator.

##Week 7

All Backbone, all the time.

##Week 8

Things we need to remember! This week is persistence, databases (Orchestrate and Postgres), authorization, and sessions. Exercise TBD.

##Week 9

Random bits and pieces go here: security, DNS, Heroku, and so on.

##Weeks 10-13

Capstone!

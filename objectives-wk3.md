#Week 3: Node, back-end, basic testing, git, and project management

The main goal for the week is to get people up to speed and working on projects. We aren't touching the browser yet, so those projects will be in Node. As such, we'll need to cover a basic intro to Node, a few libraries, and some core Node concepts like asynchronous code. We'll also want to go over tools to help with projects: git, testing, and project management.

- Intro to Node
- What is a server & why are we using Node?
  - echo server w/ curl?
- Async vs Sync
  - why bother with async? It's hard!
- node modules
- npm
- fs modules
- mocha & chai
- git?
- project management/zenhub

##Day 1

- Project Management & related tools
  - take your time, rather than diving into coding!
    - read the spec: what are we making?
    - outline the result. Psuedo-code is your friend!
    - come up with a list of tools/techs: what are we using?
    - who is doing what? Don't step on each other's toes!
  - communicate a lot
    - be sure you're all on the same page about what you're building and how!
    - ask lots of questions--don't ever feel like you ought to know everything that's going on.
    - let your teammates know when there's a problem, especially if it might impact what they're working on
    - on big projects, Agile-style standups are great
  - pair programming, or divide and conquer?
  - division of resposibility--vertical vs horizontal
  - Divide into groups and get project description?
- Git & ZenHub
  - feature-based branches!
- Introduction to the week's project
  - _(outline that here)_
- Exercises: 
  - set up Git and GitHub accounts (using SSH)
  - get global .gitignore configured
  - create project-specific GitHub organization with all team members as collaborators
  - set up ZenHub (or Trello, or whatever), start outlining the things that will need to be done
    - Have a sample--perhaps one that people can just copy, since they don't know what tasks they'll need to do? Better yet, brainstorm with the whole class a list of things to do.

##Day 2: Node and Modules

- Intro to Node: servers, modules, npm, package.json and whatnot
- modules: fs and others (underscore/lodash)
- Async, as demoed with fs.readfile
- Exercises: *Exercises are light for this day so far*
  -Install Node
  - if sudoku problem:
    - Walkthrough of the code to be parsed
  - if treehouse or code wars api problem:
    - introduction to underscore/lodash if we're doing the api course suggester thing
    - walkthrough of parsing the json file (including using fs.readFile?)

##Day 3: testing

- mocha and chai, tdd/bdd

##Day 4: project

##Day 5: project completion

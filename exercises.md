#Monday 8/10

This will be a short day, given that the first half of it will be at Laurelhurst Park, and at least an hour of the second half will be given over to admin stuff and getting-to-know-you activities.

- [Homework 1](https://github.com/portlandcodeschool/jse-fall15-1), number 1: The list of all the expressions to evaluate. This would be good pair work as people try to figure out all the edge cases.
- Potentially one other problem from Homework 1, depending on how far people get. The mean of numbers is a pretty good candidate.

#Tuesday 8/11

Finishing up some of the Homework 1 stuff would be good here, though it doesn't cover some of the things that they would learn today (boolean operators & loops/branches).

- cartesian rectangles & circles
- the checkerboard
- fraction display
- [Homework 2](https://github.com/portlandcodeschool/jse-fall15-2), problem 2 (simplifying code)
- possibly a slight modification of Homework 2, Number 3a (the letter triangle) involving just the loops, not making a function.

#Wednesday 8/12

The introduction of functions opens us up to a lot of new stuff:

- Homework 2, Number 3 (or 3b, if 3a was done on Tuesday)
- the missing & key (particularly because there were no other boolean operator problems)
- The beginning of the Cards series

#Thursday 8/13

Defensive programming & parameter checks is the theme for the day:

- Defensive cards
- today could use more exercises

#Friday 8/14

Higher-order functions!

- Write your own versions of map/forEach/etc.
- could probably use more exercises.
